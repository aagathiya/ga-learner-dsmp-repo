### Project Overview

 NLP - NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING. The project was about how do we convert a column consisting of sentences,paragraphs or whole story into numerical which can be further applied for model like Logistic Regression, SVM or Naive Bayes ie classification modelling. The application of NLP on the particular column rate the word in respect to its importance. The importance is allotted to words by different method like count vectorization, TF, IDF etc. The next step was application of classification models like Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes classifier and calculating the accuracy.
