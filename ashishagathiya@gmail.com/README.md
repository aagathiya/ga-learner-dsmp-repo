### Project Overview

 The project was based on Linear Algebra,  Matrices and fctorization of Matrices. The above topics dealt with the Vector, Vector opertions/ functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication, vector normalisation. It also dealt with orthogonal and orthonormal vector. It also covered matrices, types of matrices, orthogonal andd normalization of matrices.  the most important topic was eigen decomposition, eigen vector, Power and Modified Power method which was used extensively while solving the project.

The project was approached after going through the above topics. 


### Learnings from the project

 The above project consisted of assessment of  finding the most important page/link by the topics covered and Google pagerrank algorithm. By completing the above project, I came to know the practical use of vector and matrices in real life problem solving. Eigen vector,  EIgen values, eigen decomposition, Power method & Modified Power Method was used to solve the project. I understood the importance of how page/link gains its importance. 


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 The basic approach I followed is the knowlege of the topic, basic instruction on GreyAtom platform and videos from you tube and Google.
